# Steps to run our project
The program is a python utility library which takes in the inputs as .txt or .csv files and generates a graph datastructure as the adjacency matrix. For use of Graph Quest simply include the proper libaries in your python code and use our functions after creating a class object from them. In the future Graph Quest will be made into an importable python library using the pip installer. Few files can also be run stand alone such as min-span-tree etc.
